# Remedy Steganography-Decoder

Remedy is a Multi-Language Steganography Based Decoding Project in which uses multiple libraries and stand-alone scripts to retrieve hidden data/information from images.


## PHP

There are several versions of the PHP Varients, Some which take the Image solely based off a GET/URL input, and others that work solely off internal storage, regardless you may need to install the correct versions for either or.

for all scripts that run off of PHP 7.4, [INSTALL PHP 7.4 HERE](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-php-7-4-and-set-up-a-local-development-environment-on-ubuntu-20-04)

For all scripts that run off of PHP 8 [INSTALL PHP 8 HERE](https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/how-to-install-php-8-on-ubuntu-22-04/)

NOTE: For any scripts Taking a $_GET Parameter, they must be ran on a webserver/internal server. all else runs internally on your machine/server using local storage.

## Python

Same as the PHP Version, there will be multiple scripts created in python, all using different versions.
Such as python3 or python2, these folders/directories will be labeled as to avoid confusion.
